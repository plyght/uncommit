# uncommit

> uncommit is an automated release notes generator that installs a GitHub Actions workflow to detect version bumps and create AI-powered release notes by analyzing git diffs.

Key points:

- **One-click install**: Authenticates via GitHub OAuth, selects a repo, and installs a workflow file
- **Version detection**: Monitors `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `version.txt`, `VERSION`
- **AI providers**: Supports OpenAI and Anthropic APIs
- **Secure**: API keys are encrypted client-side with NaCl sealed_box before storing as GitHub Secrets
- **Stack**: Next.js 14, Convex backend, @convex-dev/auth for GitHub OAuth
